I'm a seasoned technical team leader and former maritime officer.  I enjoy being a coach and mentor to those I work with and work in Cloud Modernization, Organizational Change, and Blockchain.  I have been a test engineer, patent analyst, and program manager in the past.  I have taken products to market that have reached millions and managed developers who have gone on to become CTOs.

I have a Masters in Engineering, Business, as well as Law all leading to a curiosity on how the future of Cloud, DevOps, and Decentralized technologies will enage with our daily life.  You can genrally find me fiddling around with Solidity or hobbling together a website for some more artistic ventures I work with.
