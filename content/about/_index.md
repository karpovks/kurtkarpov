A seasoned Consultant, Program Manager, and Technologist I take a human-centric approach to lead lean, expert teams towards measurable success.   I work to guide the relationship between business and technology and look to refine an approach that balances people, processes, and technology.  I have been a test engineer, patent analyst, and program manager in the past.  I have taken products to market that have reached millions and managed developers who have gone on to become CTOs.

I have a Masters in Engineering, Business, as well as Law.  All these leading to a curiosity on how the future of Cloud, DevOps, and Decentralized technologies will enage with our daily life.  You can genrally find me fiddling around with Solidity or hobbling together a website for some more artistic ventures I work with.
